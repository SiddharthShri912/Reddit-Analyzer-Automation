I used to be the funniest and most energetic person in my school and college. In 11th grade, I was the class clown, making everyone laugh—some teachers liked it, others didn't. The same applied during my undergraduate years, but I changed places for my postgraduate studies.

I lived my whole life in one of India's biggest metropolitan cities. For my postgraduate studies, I moved to a Tier 2 city because the college was good, even though it was located outside the city. The local language and my classmates irritate me. Most of them are from Tier 3 cities or villages and exhibit casteism, racism, and misogyny (especially the boys). They also lack manners, like picking their noses during class and whatnot. 

I managed to get comfortable with my hostel mates, whom I considered friends for the past year since I came here. Now, because of placement preparations, they started working extra and helping each other. Since I'm from a different branch with different goals, I don't focus on placements. This has created a gap in our friendship—we stopped meeting and having meals together. They're still together; it's just me who feels left out.

I understood the situation and was okay with it until today. I heard noise outside my door and, upon opening it, saw them laughing and talking. When I asked someone what happened, they jokingly said another person was asking a monkey for a gift (an inside joke). I realized they had gone to the main city to enjoy, shop, and dine—something we used to do regularly before this semester. 

They didn't even bother to invite me.

Today, I felt true loneliness, and all those cringe quotes started making sense "In a class of a hundred, I am alone". I realized how much my life has changed, and I don't know how much more it will change. I used to be the class clown, and now I'm sad about being left out and sharing this with strangers on the internet. I'm sad, but ironically, I'm laughing.A slightly long post and the advice I'm seeking is not about bikes but about emotions and responsibilities. So you can avoid if you want.

I'm 22 and to want own the Truimph Scrambler 400x which would cost me 3.15 lakhs.

My current salary is 5 lpa wfh out of which I'm investing 3 lakhs. I freelance on the side so my monthly expenses of 10 - 12k are easily covered. Basically entire 5 lakhs I can save. Most importantly,  two years down the road I intend to do an MBA and will use those two years to tour as much as I can.

My Dilemma-
1. My job is highly unstable and in a field with no scope. (Alrhough I have freelance so not gonna die hungry)
2. My mature side wants to invest the entire sum towards a secure future. 
3. I have no family support and will have to bootstrap myself in all of my future and present endeavors. 
4. My family is stuck in a situation where we are just surviving with ups and downs in our small business. Basically we have no lifestyle. 
4. A part of me does not beleive I deserve to own something like this.


My reason -
1. I have worked hard my entire life without any recognition.
2. I have dreamt of owning a truimph when I was eight years old. Saw Tom Cruise riding one in Mission:Impossible 2.
3. The most expensive thing i have ever owned is a 22k smartphone. 
4. I have supported my college lifestyle (trips, clothes, fuel) everything on my own.

The thing is I'm at a crossroad. I have lived a mediocre life my entire life and made a promise to myself that I will do something big to make all my pain worth. Other side of me wants to be young and enjoy. I see people of my age buting sneakers worht lakhs while I cant even bring myself to buy new clothes.

If you were in my spot, what would you do?
The amendment increases the penalty for violations from Rs 5,000 to Rs 1 lakh and introduces a provision for simple imprisonment of up to three months for repeat offenders, he added.
    A key component of the amendment is the implementation of a central database management system to check the antecedents of migrant workers, the minister said.
    This system will allow the verification of criminal records, ensuring that only those without criminal backgrounds can join the workforce in Meghalaya. The labour department will coordinate with local police to ensure proper verification, he added.I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering in 2022 from a D-grade college, and honestly, I have minimal knowledge about what I studied. Right after college, I started my career in sales because it was the easiest to get into and the pay was decent compared to my classmates’ offers.

Over the past two years, I’ve worked as an SDR and switched jobs a few times:

1. **First job**: Patent consultant for 1.5 years.

2. **Second job**: Marketing platform for 3 months.

3. **Current job**: SaaS company since April.

My current salary is in the range of 10-14 INR fixed, which is considered okayish. However, I feel a bit lost and unmotivated in my sales role. I’ve been an average performer lately and it’s clear that I started in sales because I thought I’d eventually transition into an MBA. But seeing the current state of MBAs in India, it feels pointless unless you graduate from one of the top 15-20 universities.

Now, I’m considering what other career paths I can pursue to boost my career. I would really appreciate any guidance at this point. Here are my main concerns:

• I don’t feel passionate about sales and lack motivation.

• I’m unsure if an MBA is worth it unless from a top-tier university.

• I need to explore other career options that could offer better opportunities and satisfaction.

What steps can I take to identify a new career path? How can I transition into a field that aligns better with my interests and offers growth potential?

Thanks in advance for your advice!Paywalled article  perhaps some nice soul can provide an alt link.

Jokes aside, it's important to stay vigilant. These scammers can be incredibly convincing, often armed with personal information that makes them seem legitimate. They might even send fake photos of arrest warrants with your name on them. If you ever receive such calls from supposed police officers, don't hesitate to hang up. Remember, if the police were really going to arrest you, they wouldn't give you a warning call. Stay safe!



For context, let’s call myself Felicia and my mom Betty.

The scammers tried every trick in the book—courier scams, fake electricity bills, pretending to be the police—none of which worked on Felicia.

Desperate, they started calling Betty. Unfortunately for them, Felicia picked up the call. They began by asking if they were speaking to Betty, and Felicia, ever the actress, confirmed, ‘Yes, this is she.’

Then they asked if Felicia was Betty’s daughter. After confirming the relationship, the scammers introduced themselves as high-ranking officials from the Mumbai police.

Betty (aka Felicia) corrected them, ‘Actually, Felicia is my sister, not my daughter.’ The scammers fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.

They inquired if Felicia was away working or studying. Betty nonchalantly replied, ‘Oh, she ran away with someone and got married.’

The scammers then dramatically declared, ‘Do you know Felicia has committed a serious offense?’

Betty calmly replied, ‘Yes, I’m aware. She sold her husband’s property and then divorced him.’

At this point, the scammers, frustrated by the lack of gullibility, cussed and hung up. 



As title says that my friend's father is going to have a surgery but the issue is that he neither have health Insurance nor he have a job, me as a commerce background student don't know myself what the condition are but I'm attaching the reports which I have received.

" Why they have to play all this game ?" Etc . Today I leaned why.  So there's this girl who works with me and I was the only person who did anything nice to her whenever she needed some help.  I had even offered to walk to her room a few times when it got late in the night.  For her gratitude she had made dinner for me once and invited me to her room just for that. Nothing more nothing less , just to have dinner. And somehow people found out and started slut shaming her immediately.  " When will you call ME for dinner ? You will only have him huh ? When it's our chance to enter your room ? So much and more. she just wanted to be nice back to me for being nice to her.  I'm appalled as these words and taunts came from a very professional place and these people have education at the highest level. Imagine a girl you like and you have asked her out and she says yes immediately ?  They will all scream "slut" for being so "easy ". Imagine your girl saying yes for a movie immediately after you ask her out.  " slut" everyone will scream. Saying yes is a crime for women and that's why they don't at first 
To start off, I'm a content manager 

I started off as a writer, then an editor. For the last 1.5 years, I've been working as a social media manager (both freelance & full-time). I also take care of content management, in-house team collaboration, and client servicing. (Oh I also do content designing, basic Canva when the designer is OOO).

However, the problem is that I work at this startup. That too a very early stage one. But I'm not here to complain about the work hours or the lesser pay. What I want to rant about is COMMUNICATION!

OH MY GOD! I don't know if this is a India problem but we suck at asynchronous communication. Every thing has to be done over call. I send a junior a simple email, they're like "ma'am mail check nahin kiya". You send them an instruction on WhatsApp, another senior sweeps in and says "call pe samjha do, would be easier". Let's not forget the useless meetings and continuosly shifting goal posts. Just recently our co founder said "bagal waale company ne 10 cr cross kar liya, ab humein bhi karna hain" - even though we don't have the manpower.

I spend 2-3 hours on calls each day. Not to mention the client meetings I attend, the strategizing I do. Then comes my own work. At the end of the day I'm expected to meet the deadlines, regardless of how long the client meet went or what extra effort I had to put. 

I have found this common is almost all startups I've worked it. This is my second one. But I feel it's time I have to upskill myself for bigger agencies/companies out there. 

So I'm seeking advice on the following 

1. What areas should I focus on, if I want to work for a better company?
2. If we have a marketer amongst us, or a marketing manager, what skills do you consider the most desirable?

TL;DR - I'm a content marketer frustrated with poor communication at my startup, where everything is done over calls, wasting 2-3 hours daily. I'm looking to transition to a larger company and seek advice on key areas to focus on and essential skills for marketers or marketing managers. Delhi Police and frivolous chargesheets go a long way...As I stepped out of my apartment in Delhi, the warm Indian sun hit my skin, and the sounds of the city came alive. The aroma of freshly brewed chai wafted through the air, enticing me to start my day.

I hailed an auto-rickshaw and headed to the bustling streets of Old Delhi. The driver, a friendly local named Rohan, navigated through the chaotic traffic with ease. We passed by vibrant street markets, selling everything from colorful fabrics to intricate handicrafts.

As we approached the Red Fort, the Mughal-era architecture took my breath away. I spent the morning exploring the fort's majestic halls and gardens, learning about India's rich history.

Afterward, I indulged in a delicious plate of butter chicken and naan bread at a nearby restaurant. The flavors danced on my taste buds, and I felt grateful for this culinary experience.

In the evening, I strolled along the Yamuna River, watching the sunset behind the city's skyline. The sound of temple bells and the gentle lapping of the river against the shore created a serene atmosphere.

As night fell, I returned to my apartment, feeling grateful for another day in this incredible city. Delhi, with its rich history, diverse culture, and warm people, had truly become my home.

This story offers a glimpse into the vibrant daily life in Delhi, India, showcasing its:

- Rich history and architecture
- Bustling streets and markets
- Delicious cuisine
- Serene natural spots
- Warm and friendly locals

Delhi's unique blend of tradition and modernity makes it a fascinating place to live and explore.I (23M) started earning last year.  
My father owns a small general store back in hometown.  
In past 4-5 yrs, shop is not doing that great, so well it was my plan that I'll help my father in growing the shop/ helping him out in the way he wants.  
Until now, I have helped him with 2.5L rs for the shop. He today demanded 20k more, to which I sent 30k instead, which he promises to return (ik he won't be able to).  
Well it was not an issue with 2.5L, but today i am thinking what about me? I will have to help next year in house renovation, this year in brother's education (as he'll be starting college soon). My personal savings are on hold until then.  
I am happy to help him, but thing is... my ex-gf gave me reality check, she said my father dont have anything and no one will wanna marry me because of no generational wealth (which we all know is true). I dont know if I should say anything to him or not... Or help him later in any monetary way or not.  
IK i should help him, he grew me up, made me who i am with very little he had.... all i am keeping on thinking is that if this will be going on for years then maybe I wont be able to save anything for myself.

I just need your opinions, whether I am thinking it in a right way? or not? or if I am wrong? or he is wrong?  
i dont know, i am sorry.. i am soooo confused right now.Lakshya Sen is through to Badminton men singles semis in the Olympics. With this he becomes the first Indian to reach badminton semi finals in the Olympic gamesBeen seeing a lot of cases of floods - from bad to worst - and very severe heatwaves during the summer. Recently kerala has been affected so badly, and assam before that, and now some parts of north india as well. It is more like a pattern now and whats next? and what can we do to prevent these things?

The effects of climate change seems to have struck very harshly this time. But what if its just the start? 

I think it is certainly attributed to the global climate change. But at the same time it is also high time we think more seriously about disaster management, better infrastructure, and see facts as facts and act on it rather than arguing over culture/beliefs. 

Its also high time we look into the environmental issues seriously and act on it. And we should do whatever we can as a single individual person, so that collectively it will have a greater impact. Also we should question the government if they arent taking this seriously still. 



Just something that came to my mind. 

What are your thoughts?We have become extremely overcrowded and with climate change - disasters await us 


Emigrate when you can. We are very very overcrowded in a dysfunctional society with a government that only does jhumla.

India cannot and will not organize itself into a modern society
Calamities like waynad or drowning in a basement or die in a train accident or far more frequent suicides/road accidents await most of the middle class/poorer class

Just on the news

https://www.ndtv.com/pune-news/on-camera-iron-gate-falls-on-3-year-old-pune-girl-she-dies-6245765/amp/1

In the west the builder who built the gate would be held liable - sued and either pay or go to prison in a timely fashion

We don’t have that concept - we will arrest a SUV driver for driving in flooded street when students die in a basement classroom that had no permission

We have no hope no hope - bridges fall trains derail people die - no one no one is held accountable- we cannot organize a developed society until we change and we won’t 




To be a modern society it requires the following 
- a truly educated citizenry that does critical thinking (not WhatsApp university grads)
- a rule following culture ( all we need to see is when Indians line up at air India counter :) 
- law above power
- thinking as humans rather than caste religion nonsense

We stand no chance - for those who believe in Amritkaal stay back and those who have a functioning head - emigrate while you can to the west

It’s not all milk and honey in the west, but unquestionably better than India - unless you are filthy rich like Ambanis 😀😀 future is bleak in motherland 

No need to get all patriotic - India stays within you (good/bad) till you die even if you emigrateHey guys, this is Harshit Sharma. I'm 17 years old, and for the past year, it's been a real battle. I have this nasty curve in my spine called scoliosis, and the pain... Well, it's like nothing I've ever felt. It's gotten so bad that my whole back throbs all the time. Forget about online classes, even sitting upright is a struggle.

Things are tougher because I also have this condition called SMA II, which makes my muscles super weak. I haven't been able to stand on my own two feet for the past seven years. Imagine studying and managing everything by yourself from the age of 11!

On top of all this, some people even said nasty things to my parents, like "Why bother educating him? He'll just die anyway." Those comments stung, but when I topped the city in my 10th exams, it shut them right up.

The problem is, spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (SMAII ) makes my muscles super weak, even raising my hands is a challenge. This makes the surgery risky. But I'm not giving up. Any contribution, big or small, will help me get the surgery I need. Please, anything you can spare would be a huge blessing.

The doctors at AIIMS Delhi suggested urgent surgery.  I request you to contribute whatever you can so that I can have timely surgery.

Throughout my life  I was consistently labeled as below average  I have 2 brothers both were excellent in studies and now have good jobs. Since childhood I have very low self confidence and my parents (both are teachers) they always compared me with my brothers, or my tuition friends. The constant comparisons were relentless, and the refrain was always the same: "You don’t work hard enough," or "It seems like you don’t put any effort into your studies." These words became a refrain in my life, echoing every time I fell short, every time I couldn’t meet the expectations set by those around me. 

Growing up was hard, as I got into science and then engineering. I always came in the bottom 10 throughout my education but passed all exams. Always felt disgusted about myself and jealous of my brothers seeing there excellent performance. I remember my parents always saying when my results came out "look towards your brothers and cousins learn from them and from now give more time and efforts in studies."  

I struggled to retain knowledge unless I had my notes or code snippets in front of me. The fear of not knowing something, is paralyzing. This has been a problem for long time, since my schooling days and it got worsen over time. 

Since my parents are teachers they didn't allowed me to do anything else such as going out with friends, watch tv, or gaming even reading novels/books or playing chess. They dismissed all these activities as "time pass," leaving me socially awkward and without any interests or hobbies.  

Now find myself disinterested in studying as I have spent a lot time in it never got anything out of it only failure and taunts. Now my parents say "spend you night and day to prepare of govt. exams." Its very embarrassing but my parents and my brother spends there time with me to solve quant, gk stuff etc. First of all I feel very embarrassed, secondly soon after 15 mins they start screaming and saying I can't even do basic math or if I make some mistake or I am unable to understand what they told me. 

Spending these study sessions with my family feels like a torture and pain. I often zone out as I don't understand what they teach and it would be hitting yourself with a boomerang if I say I don't understand. So I only nod to them that I understand and write what they tell me to like a dictation of math. Currently after weeks of these daily study sessions. I have zero understanding of the concepts and I feel I would do much better if I study alone. But they won't leave me alone as they feel I need to be under someone constanlty such that they know that I get the concepts.

There is a strange feeling now that I don't want to do anything because I feel I would not be able to do anything as there are students who are far invested in studies than me and being an Indian in this huge competition there is no way someone like myself would get a job. I have also accepted the fact of me being useless, and I feel that getting a job will literally take my soul. And I would like to just skip my life to my death bed. I feel I have lost my identity which I had when I was younger. Hi everyone,

I need some advice and want to know if anyone else faces the same issue. I feel like I'm always getting overcharged by local technicians for small jobs, and I'm wondering if it's just me or a common problem.

Recently, I had an electrician come over to fix a few things:

1. He installed 4 buttons and fixed a fan regulator. Although the buttons were fine, the regulator didn't work as expected; it was only slightly faster but not fully fixed. I pointed this out to him, but since he had already installed it, I think he found it too much effort to remove and replace it. Somehow, he convinced me that it was working fine as it is.

2. Before this, he repaired a bell, charging me ₹150 for the bell, ₹40 for a button, and ₹110 for labor, totaling ₹300. This was just 20-30 minutes before the regulator issue. After fixing the bell, I mentioned that the regulator was also faulty. He quickly went to get the parts and returned within 2 minutes.

3. For the regulator work, he charged ₹100 for 4 buttons, ₹150 for the regulator, and ₹200 for labor, totaling ₹450.

I think my introverted personality plays a role here. I'm not very good at negotiating or confronting people, so I end up paying whatever they ask for. One thing is the lack of quality work, and on top of that, he charged labor twice—₹100 once and ₹200 another time. This feels like he's just making up labor charges as he goes.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you handle it? Do you have any tips for ensuring fair pricing without feeling too awkward or confrontational? I'd really appreciate hearing your experiences and advice.**~May ‘2024~**

I found a property listed  
on NoBroker in Hyderabad almost within my budget. Scheduled an  
appointment for visiting the flat, the current tenant was a Pilot with an  
obvious erratic roster and hence a poor schedule to show the flat as he was  
unavailable most of the times. This went for a few weeks, and by the time i  
visited the flat, i had done some research around the flat floor plan, its  
location, society and all. The price was marked as negotiable which i thought  
could be bright down by another 10%.

 

**~21~****~^(st)~** **~May ‘2024~**

Visited the flat, the  
tenant was very welcoming, showed us around, except for minor niggles, we liked  
the overall deal and wanted to close it asap. Now, here starts the actually  
story of how NoBroker in the name of no brokerage charges  
hefty amounts from buyers all in the form of deceit and bad faith.

 

**~22~****~^(nd)~** **~May ‘2024~**

The day following my  
visit to the property, I received a call from a NoBroker agent named  
R at 12.44PM and he said he would negotiate on my behalf and wanted to know the  
price I wanted it at. The property was listed at Rs 1.2cr negotiable  
on NoBroker. NoBroker in the name of privacy does not share  
Sellers contact details and rightly so. I quoted Rs 1.05cr, R came back with a  
last price from seller as Rs 1.11cr. which after a slight hesitation said OK,  
though it was over my budget. All these can be confirmed via call recording  
which NoBroker claims they have. I also have them on emails from R.

Now, after closing the  
verbal deal, R said that the buyer wanted me to pay a token of Rs 2.25 lakhs  
and the payment would be made via NoBroker app so it will be  
absolutely safe and i will receive the invoice for the same. I asked R what was  
it for them, and did they charge anything from Seller, he response was that the  
Seller had taken a premium plan and all this was part of that service. I said  
OKAY. R tried to sell an end to  
end service which included all legal and loan services(including incidental and  
under-the-table changes),  I said NO as I was already over my  
budget. R brought down that amount by 40% and I still said No. He again  
came back in sometime and offered me a complete waiver of legal fees if i paid  
*advance of Rs 2.25lakhs as token amount to seller the same day.* I was a bit taken back with this offer, my  
gut instinct thought it was fishy and I was a bit concern by constant  
insistence of R. He said that the above said offer was only for that day and  
would expire the next day.

My wife sensed my  
desperation and asked to hold the payment for next day. I made an excuse that  
the next day was more auspicious so I will make the payment the following day,  
R outright said “The offer is  
valid only for today, ask anyone in NoBroker and you will not get  
**free legal services if payment is made tomorrow”**. I wanted to close the deal and eventually paid  
Rs 2.25L by my credit card via a link on Nobroker. I was told time and again that the entire amount  
of Rs 2.25L will be transferred to Seller the following day and I would receive  
**an invoice for the same.** There  
were more than 12 telephonic exchanges between R and me that day.

Late in night i received  
an email from R that he will be on leave the following day and I should reach  
out to his manager S . I was again taken aback because if it was planned  
leave he should have told me call earlier and his entire story of offer being valid for that day  
**was a lie because he wanted to close the deal** and get brownie points for it.

**~23~****~^(rd)~** **~May ‘2024~**

Next day, i called S and  
turns out that he is on planned leave too. I received a call from  
another NoBroker agent **“N”** who said she would help me with managed  
services I had opted for. Out of curiosity i asked her what amount I paid for  
this service and she said it was Rs 2lakhs and only Rs 25k was sent to seller.  
I was shocked, i asked for some other agent who claimed innocence and said were  
not aware of what the deal was and asked me to went for the next day. 

**~24~****~^(th)~** **~May ‘2024~**

I kept my patience and  
waited the following day for a call from R, he did not call me until i called  
up asking what was he up to. He spins a news story this time saying the Rs 2 lakh  
was actually being paid by Seller and he had opted for these services. I was  
convinced that he was coming up with another set of bullshits. By this time, i  
had managed to get the number of Seller from NoBroker. It was again a  
spoofed number, I called him up, a gentleman he is. He told me the deal was at  
Rs 2 lakhs cheaper that what i was told(i.e. was finalized at Rs 1.09cr.), I  
was kind of expecting this, i called up R thereafter, R was not available and  
the call was attended by his manager. I told the lies that were fed to me till  
now and instead of listening to me, he claimed I had agreed to the services and  
it was hence sold to me, i lost my patience and asked him to bring R on  
conference. Now I was sure both of them were colluding in this deceit.

I asked R if at any point  
of time he told me about this additional services which was being sold to me, i  
recorded the call and i knew it would serve as evidence later on. R agreed that  
he did not, S apologized for lack of communication which i told was a deliberate  
lie and he should not sell it as misunderstanding. At this time, S started  
shouting on me and was not letting me speak.

I had to remind him that  
I was a customer whom they have sold a Rs 2lakh worth package without my  
consent or information. He threatened me and told me to cancel the deal and  
also said there were many interested buyers for the property, but even if i  
canceled it he would not refund me any amount.

I tried to act calm and  
realized i have been already scammed by a bunch of crooks and I should sort it  
out and try to get some discounts rather than fighting with them. I request  
them to give me some discount as it was a hard earned money and this property  
was important to me.

S was extremely rude to  
me and tried to warn me of not giving in any service, i ended the call saying i  
was no longer interested in talking to S any longer and wanted  
another agent for my calls. S almost threatened me saying "If you are not  
interested there are multiple buyers interested in this property", were  
his exact words. 

After all this, I  
realized there was no point in fighting unless my property was  
registered. I got a call from NoBroker team asking feedback, I told  
them this entire story, no action taken, no follow up. 

The point of contact  
which was assigned to me lacked any information, did not do basic proof reading  
of agreement of sale shared by Advocate, was thoroughly checked multiple times  
by me and the seller. Same happened for coordination with seller for anything,  
the entire process was erratic, none of the team members  
of NoBroker team were responsive and the service which was sold to me  
was not even worth Rs 10,000/-.  I could not directly reach out to  
Advocate, it had to be done only via Nobroker agent and this caused  
numerous delays, lack of communication. I general observation  
across NoBroker agent is that they said Yes and Okay to anything and  
everything without understanding what was being told or asked. The agents  
have no clarity on what the sales team sold and what they had to  
deliver. All colleague of mine who got this entire process done at his own end,  
did it in mere 15 days with peace of mind, the service which was forcefully  
shoved down my throat was only hassles for me 

Day of Registration  
**~i.e. 5~****~^(th)~** **~July~**

The seller and I had  
communicated more than 10 days prior about being available on this day for  
registration. After multiple follow ups with N and Nobroker team and  
its advocate, we reached on time for property registration. Upon reaching, I realized  
the seller had come alone and brought power of attorney on behalf of his  
mother(who was co-owner of the property). He had informed about the same  
to Nobroker team atleast 4 days prior, still  
the Nobroker team did not bother to inform either advocate or verify  
the power of attorney document he had shared. It was such a chaos at  
registration office and everyone including us and my witness had to return back  
as registration was not possible with that document. The seller spent money to  
fly down his mother that evening for registration to happen next day. Again,  
there were quite a few errors as pointed by the registration office in the sale  
deed which could have been easily identified. 

Nothing was prompt, I had  
to follow up on small things literally everyday, the agents conveniently  
ignored calls or responded when they felt like, no priority or  
urgency shown towards customer. Extremely shoddy. Even on the day of  
registration i.e. 5^(th) July, no representation was made  
from NoBroker, only advocate sent his associates . Following a big miss  
from Nobroker all parties had to assemble again the following day leading to  
loss of time and money.

 TL;DR; NoBroker  
agents and team lied and deceived me into buying their assistance service while  
buying a property listed in their app. In addition the service was extremely  
pathetic and abysmal. What can i do?

 Why such a massive tragedy is still not getting the attention it should? No one around me is bothered about it.After capturing the mainstream media, the Modi Government has now turned its eye on independent content creators. These content creators, independent journalists, political commentators and satirists have long been a thorn in the side of the Narendra Modi. Over the last decade, as the mainstream media turned into a lapdog of the Government (Godi Media), and honest journalists were muzzled and driven out from their platforms, these content creators used their platform to speak truth to power. They have allowed us to see the truth, in an era where reality is hidden behind curtains and our access to information is being restricted. Truth is falsified, books are being rewritten, and propaganda reels are used to hide the reality of our crumbling nation. All in service of the Non-Biological Supreme Leader.

> Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.

It is important to note, that today it is the Government which is the largest purveyor of falsehood and fake news. Union Ministers openly claim that Modi stopped Russia-Ukraine War, or that no one died from hunger, or that no paper leak took place in seven years.

The journalists who dare to speak truth, are persecuted, raided, and imprisoned for years without bail. Even social media is not free of the Government's tyranny. Modi Government has often misused the law to take down content from Twitter and YouTube. Many accounts which were critical of the Government have been withheld. In January 2024, when protests erupted in Patna over Railway recruitment, the Government forced the YouTube to take down videos in the name of national security.

With the Broadcast Services bill, the Modi Government has set its sight on independent content creators on social media. The bill, which has been shrouded in secrecy, has been provided to select stakeholders, with unique watermarks.

Under this bill, all independent content creators, who discuss news and current affairs, will be classified as “digital news broadcasters”. It would include all textual, audio, visual, and live programs. It would apply to bloggers, podcasters, and even satirists on Twitter, living in India, or outside. It would also regulate social media intermediaries and advertising networks. Further, these “digital news broadcasters” will be subject to vague provisions, which can be selectively applied.

The Broadcasting Services Bill is the final nail in the coffin of the independent news. It is a devious scheme to muzzle free speech and suppress the reality.

She is 52 years old and has been selected to represent India on the world stage. We come from a lower-middle-class family and have already spent a lot on her training costs and national-level competitions. We now find it extremely hard to support her dreams further.

Her participation in the World Championship was supposed to be funded by the government, but instead, we faced rejections from them. Today, she received her official invitation for the competition, and we are in urgent need of any support and help.

Here's a little backstory about her: 28 years ago, she received the same opportunity, but due to a lack of support from the government, she couldn't pursue her dreams at that time. She made a remarkable comeback and won 2 gold medals, in both hands, making her a national arm wrestling champion.

She has now been working tirelessly in the gym and is giving her all. At her age today, time is not on her side, and this might be her last chance to pursue her dreams. We have been desperately trying everything possible to make things work for her this time.

We have started a Ketto fundraiser for her, and I’ll also share her bank details. Any help would be greatly appreciated and will help my mom pursue her dreams and make our country proud.

Rs. 58,612 of 4,02000 Raised.So today , I ( 19 M ) was travelling to my grandparents house via a private bus . So , i had booked seat no. 3 for myself ( tho the same price as all other seats it had a bit more leg room than others thus i ended up booking this one ) . Moving forward to the moment i boarded the bus i saw a lady occupying my seat . There was a bit of a rush so the bus conductor told me to sit in seat no. 5 ( less leg space ) for a while . After the rush cleared out he told me to continue sitting in that seat and gave my original seat to the lady . 

I told the bus conductor that this wasn’t the seat that i had booked and wanted to sit in my original seat . The tone with which he spoke to me was as if he was doing me a favour or as if i was travelling for free . Then i asked the lady and guess what : i was faced with ignorance.
I decided to drop the convo as you never know how things could pan out , maybe she could have created a scene there and tbh it wasnt worth fighting or creating a scene over leg space right . 

Tbh it was never abt leg space . There are just two problems : 
1. Professionalism: If i am paying an x amount of money for a service i dont pay that amount to get mistreated right . Had the bus conductor spoken to me properly things would have been better . The fact that i was just a single person that too of a much younger age he was trying to act superior ( for god knows what reason ) .

2. The lady : Had the lady asked me properly for a seat exchange i would have done it then too. But u cant just take someone’s seat and act all ignorant right . 

So all in all i want to say, just a little bit of kindness could have done it all . Are we really so thankless to others . 

Btw if you read through all of this then thanks really , let me know what all viewpoints do you guys have This is a question every so called middle class tax payer who earns 15 lakhs per annum (and upwards) has in this country. Just wanted to put up a friendly reminder of what sort of country you live in.

To top this off, we have become a nation of religious zealots, satisfied that we are at least better than Pakistan, which is a troubled state with many, many problems of their own. 

So stop with your bewildered questions. The problems are obvious. Just open your eyes and see.10 days ago I ordered a supplement from Amazon. This product was a USA manufactured with all third party lab tests done in USA itself. Few days later, I order another supplement to compliment the first one. This too was a USA based. 
Next I received the first order.. This one turned out to be a cheap knockoff with a different spelling, badly printed and pasted sticker, and capsules with unknown substance filled up. Called the customer service, got a refund and was asked to dispose the product. 

Received the second order. Same situation. 

Wrote reviews. Didn't display on the product page.
Found more products from the same seller where users had the same complaint.  
Asked to flag the seller. Nothing done. 
Found another replacement of the first, but my trust was ruined. 
Decided not to purchase with Amazon anymore. 

Went on Flipkart and purchased the alternative. Flipkart has the policy where you can unbox the package in front of the delivery person. So in case the product is wrong, it can be immediately returned. Conditions applied.

Compared to Amazon, paid 1₹ more. But I guess it's worth it.

I have been living in India the last 9 years (mainly India, but I travel a lot). 

One thing that makes living here uncomfortable is the jealousy amongst Indians. Shopkeepers, friends, people are generally  kind until they see you speaking to other Indians. Then they become inquisitive, nosey and jealous - asking questions about your personal life and your relationships, demanding “why didn’t you buy from me!? Where have you been? ” It’s extremely uncomfortable. 

I have lived in many other countries before but India is the only place where this type of attitude/ jealousy is across the majority. 

Another thing is I find their questions so degrading. “Where are you from? What is your job?” Then I see them calculating how to judge you (maybe this is a result of the caste system and them trying to figure us out). There is no “how are you? What’s up for you?” Not even a “what’s your name?” Nope. Just “what’s your job?” And often them asking you a question relating to how much money you have, and then “what’s your dad’s job?” After that, there is no deeper conversation, it seems they have all the information they need regarding how to interact with you.

Recently I moved into a house. The landlord keeps showing up randomly, asking where I’ve been, what I’m doing. I had to get my laptop fixed and they demanded to see my laptop actually opening up my bag. They saw my iPhone “oh is that Apple? Must be expensive? How much you pay?” Constantly trying to work out how much I have?? 

Perhaps it’s because I’m a single woman too that they feel they can invade my boundaries this way? 

I’m sorry, but I’m just so fed up on this mannerless objectifying culture. Anyone shed any light?   Air India Suspends Tel Aviv Flights Amid Escalating Middle East Tensions

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-india-suspends-tel-aviv-flights-amid-escalating-middle-east-tensions-6246272So, just for background. I studied and now work in Europe’s biggest economy. However, whole family is in India. Now, I make sure to never say a bad word about India in front of my non-Indian colleagues. 

However, yday I was talking to some of my long-time (>7 years) Indian friends about the recent news that I read on reddit (floods, porsche case, leaking parliament, rooftops falling, people getting electrocuted, etc.). Now these friends also work in Europe.

So, on the call, I just mentioned that it’s not good, that people are dying or getting injured due to mismanagement, incompetent governance, etc. And suddenly they both became heavily aggressive. They said that “all you read is negative news, we don’t get such news, you can’t blame India just coz you’re living here. Our families are there, problems are everywhere, even Europe gets flooded, don’t act oversmart” and many more things in the same direction.

I never “blamed” India. I love it, it’s my country and I’m the first one to always say that I’ll go back. But just mentioning one country’s problems, doesn’t mean that I’m saying that the country I live in is the best, here everything’s good, blah blah. I just said what I read. That’s it. But Idk why they became aggressive. 

Now I’m not a person seeking validation here, but this is bugging me since the call. Am I the Asshole for focusing on ‘negative’ things? Am I the entitled bitch who’s sitting in Europe and ‘blaming’ India? I feel that this behaviour was not needed from them, but I just want to confirm whether it is how I think or something else. 

Woule love to hear your inputs & comments :)

Have a Good Friday and a great start in the weekend 😊


Edit: I think some of the comments are focussing more on political ideologies. Just FYI, I’m also a BJP supporter. Earlier I was because I liked them, now I am because I don’t like others. See the difference? Just thought of putting this here so people don’t support/bash me coz of my political ideologies. This imho is not a political discussion I am writing this post to bring to your attention the long-standing and unresolved issue surrounding the validation of AMIE (Associate Member of the Institution of Engineers) degrees. This case has been dragging on in the Delhi High Court for far too long, causing undue stress and uncertainty for countless students and professionals who have worked tirelessly to earn their qualifications.

The AMIE degree has historically been recognized as equivalent to a traditional engineering degree, allowing graduates to pursue higher studies, secure jobs, and contribute meaningfully to the engineering field. However, the ongoing legal limbo has thrown the futures of these individuals into jeopardy, leaving them in a state of professional and academic paralysis.

It's disheartening to see the lack of urgency in resolving this matter. Many AMIE degree holders have spent years working hard, often balancing jobs and studies, to achieve this qualification. They deserve clear and unequivocal validation of their degrees. This isn't just about academic recognition; it's about fairness, justice, and the right to pursue one's career without unnecessary legal and bureaucratic hurdles.

We call upon the Delhi High Court to expedite the hearing and deliver a verdict that restores confidence and clarity to the AMIE community. The prolonged delay not only undermines the credibility of the AMIE program but also tarnishes the faith in our judicial system to deliver timely justice.

If you or someone you know has been affected by this issue, please share your experiences and support this call for immediate action. It's time we collectively raise our voices and demand a swift and fair resolution. The future of many aspiring engineers depends on it.

Let's stand together and urge the Delhi High Court to prioritize this case and bring it to a just conclusion.

#JusticeForAMIE #ValidateAMIE #AMIEinDelhiHC

---

Please share your thoughts and spread the word. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that the hard work of AMIE degree holders is recognized and respected.

---

TL;DR: The prolonged delay in the Delhi High Court's decision on the validation of AMIE degrees is causing undue stress and uncertainty for graduates. It's time for the court to expedite the hearing and deliver a verdict, ensuring fairness and justice for AMIE degree holders.***

[WR 10](https://www.issf-sports.org/competitions/worldranking/SKM). Top 6 to finalSo I'm 26M currently working in a big company as a computer operator, it's a gold jewellery so work time is top much (12-14 hours) each day, even on weekends but salary is good which is around 28k per month and they give accomodation and food. The smaller company doesn't give any of that.

The problem is that the manager of my current company hates me for unknown reason, so much so that he in his local language insults me in front of others even though my work is good, I have to give him evidence that I didn't do any mistake and it was his favourite staff fault, only then he stay quiet. Due to this I'm stressing out that if I did a mistake he is going to eat me (even though he tries to do this on a daily basis). The new company is a new E-commerce company which is offering me around 25k but the job time is really good just the salary is low in comparison to the current one.

Since in the current company I can only learn about their software whereas in the different company I can learn a lot other stuff which can actually help me to grow further, I was thinking to switch but my family is against it.

I hope I can get any advice on what to do on it, good pay or good time for my mind.

(Sorry for my bad English or any incomplete info)My grandmother got this from India when she travelled there. I had never really looked at it and always assumed it was an elephant with its trunk up but looking closer it's probably a bird right?

Thanks!When I was in India, the basketball coach was extremely strict and just bad at teaching. The "teaching" style was horrendous, he would like us up in front of the basket's free throw line (which seems normal at first) to make free throws, but he would beat and slap students who can't make it. ON TOP OF THAT, this coach ONLY made us stationary dribble AND walk around while dribbling. He wouldn't let us play pick up games, or normal friendly competitive games, no breaks, nothing. 

Now compare that to the US, the teaching style is way more friendly and less strict, with mistakes being less punishing and more of a learning opportunity. Here they know that the best way to learn is to actually experience it with playing games on the court. They don't make us to ONLY stationary dribbling and moving around, they make us speed dribble, teaching different ways to dribble and defend with 1v1 games with peers to teach how to defend against an opponent and also how to play offense against an opponent, there is way more nuance and complexity over here, having competitive friendly matches is super fun and amazing. Here's another observation I made, I learnt basketball WAYY faster in the US than in India. I got way more fluid and dynamic with my plays rather than in India where I would be stiff and move like a brick.

Important thing to note are the conditions of where this was happening, when I practiced basketball in India, it was outdoors, worst thing ever, it was so hot and sweaty and everyone was smelling like shit, I noticed that none of my peers wears deodorant or antirespirant(which made it way more horrid) and you had to buy your own ball (which in the US they already have). 

Sorry if you were offended in any way, I don't know if all the coaches are like this but this is my personal experience. I am born and raised in India tho. Also I want to emphasize how much the coach in India beat up and ridiculed the students who made such a minor and simple mistake. It was terrible.This happened months ago.
I am an IT employee in Bangalore, though not a native of the state (am from Kerala). 

One day, while driving to buy groceries I saw in the middle of the street a scene of domestic violence, where a husband was beating his wife really badly and that too in front of his kids.
They appeared to be manual labourers or even could have been poor beggars judging by their ragged clothes and appearance. The guy was shouting in Kannada, which I dont speak and barely understand.

I was literally shocked because it was like a scene straight out of a film, it was happening in broad daylight and I had never seen a guy beat a woman irl especially this badly. Worst part was he was doing it in front of his kids and it was a full blown beatup where the woman was lying on the ground and he was still beating her.
It was a Sunday noon, so the streets were pretty empty.
Couldn't intervene mainly bcoz I was driving and had to keep my eyes on the road. But now that I think of it, even if I were walking im unsure how I would have reacted other than maybe recording it and then if I'm unlucky getting confronted by him. Would have had more confidence on how I would have reacted if I spoke the language and could have intervened.

Want to know if there was any helpline I could have called to report this besides the police in case I witness something similar ?
Even if I were to call the police, would it have helped, especially since they would have moved on once I started calling the police and reported the incident ?We went during a heat wave which was the worst time to go, but we still enjoyed the culture and historical places. The Taj Mahal was worth it and I can see why it’s one of the 7 wonders of the world especially after learning about its history It’s like we(India) have become educated robots producing machine but they don’t pay us we pay them to go there and once our children are born there we are no more Indian. 

We Indian love slaves. For use it is once an employee always an employee. We don’t see other people hard work and the torture they have been through to change their self and mind you change is tough pill to swallow. 

Indian are very bad at everything( I hate my self for this) we have world class specs to ignore like garbage and benefiting hobbies and many more and the main problems is again slavery you don’t give poor money rich don’t give middle class money and this cycle will always continue. 

I am a Muslim but this caste system is still running in our blood we all love to judge. What’s your percentage? What do you do for living? We should never judge person but if you know he is weak you should be he older brother and keep guiding him where and how you learn thing to be better off this world and how to learn that 

“How to learn” one how the most important things to teach other. You guide and immature person but never guide a mature person please. Teach him how he can do it, let him do it and see if he can do it don’t judge him there too. I want to be entrepreneur, I want to open factory or I want business which can be opened for minimum and can be large scale business but no one will tell you how you can do it even if they have some insight they will say oh this oh that.

YouTube shorts and reels are just destroying you all. Always think you are paying some random vlogger or uneducated rat money who will never even take a selfie with you and note this down a selfie is nothing but a prove of you wasted time so much time for least dominant person (I don’t know how to explain that). You could have praised someone who is showing you knowledge and I also get it being a YouTube is a skill and the name of the game is how can hook you up they most professional people don’t have time for hooking you up . 


There are still 1000more problem I can share(maybe I will write more) but we need each other. Your friend are not the close one your family is not the close one. Your India is not the close one. Your world is not the close one. The real close one is there person who want to learn your expertise or experience. You can’t teach anyone who doesn’t want to you can only give a opinion that’s all I am a student of a tier three engineering college, and I have been pursuing an "internship" at CDAC.

So what happened was one day a senior contacted me and asked me if was interested in pursuing an internship at CDAC.
I was desperate at that time for internship so I blindly said yes
I am from CS background and I would consider myself to be a decent coder.

What followed was 3 months of pure pain and mental harassment.

I was asked to complete validations on a data set that too like 300 a day for 15-17 days.
After that we were asked to complete a course on deep learning which we completed after 1.2 months.

 During this period we weren't allotted any project or anything, nor did we have any meetings, all the while the lerson under which were were doing "internship" just shouted on us.

After completion of this course, he just gave us 2 more courses to complete without saying anything.

Today he called us and asked for updates and just shouted on us so much, he harassed us.
Whenever he is pissed, he calls us and shouts on us, he just needs a reason.

I have a friend who is a Tamil who is also an "intern" at CDAC, he visited his home for 15 days for vacation after semester papers and this person just made his life hell.

He used to call my friend and order him to just find people who can read tamil and speak 100 Tamil sentences on his shitty website.
My friend was there for some festival and he was busy yet this person just ordered him to go to people's houses. Catch them, hold them and do whatever it takes to read sentences online.

After today's event we are extremely fed up and don't know what to do.
We went to this CDAC from our college so tomorrow we will talk out teacher and leave this in between.
We don't even want his shitty certificate.

I just wanted to share my experience and I want your opinions on it.Right, so, I have a Punjabi family wedding coming up soon and Im super excited but i gotta get it off my chest - I'm so out of touch w the culture and just the entire concept in general because my parents prioritise education so I haven't really gone to big outings like weddings or community things in a LONG LONG LONG time... hence im very out of touch with the culture..

Soo im coming to Reddit (hopefully a safe space) to just ask for some advice/just to be explained very blatantly - TELL ME how to be RESPECTFUL and LIKEABLE PLS.

Because i haven't been to a reception in YEARS and ibfr i don't speak Hindi/Punjabi, so it is a *struggle* being respectful to the AuntyJi's when i dont even know what they're trying to tell me 

Also yk like culturally??? Anything i shoudln't do? Like nails n stuff. I was deeping it and i realised ive never seen someone wear fake/long nails. Are they allowed or are they a nono??? Little things like that - pls fill me in on *everything*.

Basically, i just need a punjabi reception/wedding etiquette lesson please. Socially, presentation-wise, communication-wise, manners-wise... Anything everything however big however small, FLOOD ME in replies and inbox.

please and ty xx

TLDR; pls give advice for social etiquette for a Punjabi wedding 



(and also please don't judge me or be mean, I'm coming for help and with good intentions 🙂🙏)I am 19M. Pursuing 2 degrees, one in data science, one in computer science and engineering. Though it might sound stressful, it is not. I am keeping up fairly well and keeping above average grades in both of them (9.0 CGPA in DS and 7.0 in CSE). 

I have the best parents in the entire world. My father has never scolded me, let alone hit me in all the 19 years I have been alive. They have provided me with everything I need. They bought me a new laptop just for learning Linux as it couldn't run on my previous laptop. I, too, never deny any errand that doesn't concern me. If they tell me to get something done I do it asap. 

Sounds perfect right? 

I still get into random rage moments. Since I joined college, I get into rage fits and start behaving irrationally. If they ask me to go to the market to get something for my sake, I will likely deny. Now and then my mom will "overserve" me (4 home-grown mangoes at a single sitting, for example) I had dark circles in my eyes, so she got me eyedrops, eye cream and multivitamins(without telling me) . I got irritated and said its too much. I got a good scolding for it. (my mom does keep me in check) 

Previously, whenever I got these rage spikes, I used to practice very mild self harm (stabbing with a pen with no ink left), which was insanely effective at calming me down. My sister caught me one day and made me realize it wasn't right, so I broke that habit and let the anger cool on its own. but if I feel REALLY angry again, I would inflict pain in a harmless way to calm me down. 

But today, even after the "anger control", my fit escalated into suicidal thoughts. I have never had these before and genuinely don't want these ever again. I cannot seek a shrink or anyone, as that would require me revealing my habits to my parents, something I won't ever do. I really want to live a happy and fulfilling life. But I have no clue what is wrong with me, let alone know how to fix myself. This weirdly looking thing in the first image as you can see it looks like a pumpkin shaped something but its not fruit or vegetable alike. Its like a sponge, currently its monsoon here and it happened to be in my its more like house entryway/ lane like slim like place where i got some plants. I thought intially its a snail. I touched it and felt like somthing sucking at the bottom. You can see the second image how small this is comparing to my finger( ignore my ugly finger). Hi everyone, this is a bit lengthy long post so I appreciate your patience and for any guidance you can offer.

I was working as a Team Lead/Asst. Manager at a BPO and left my job without any offer in hand. Primary reasons were because of less salary as compared to peers (internally promoted staff always get lesser pay for some reason) and after working continuously in night shift for a year and half my health was being affected. 
My original plan was to sit at home for about 3 months with whatever savings/gratuity money/loan I had and become fit, learn new skills and escape from customer service/BPO forever.

I am happy and grateful that I got time to do things I enjoy, lose weight and sleep at night and I'm doing online courses but I kinda failed to assess how bad the job situation was in our country. 

It's been more than 6 months I'm without a job. While I did get occasional calls (mostly from job consultancy firms hiring for BPOs) but I'm reluctant to return to BPO and night shifts. 
I moved to Gurgaon from a smaller city about 6 years ago and joined the organisation as a customer service agent, and gradually getting promoted to be a Team Leader. 

I am finding it very difficult to even be called for an interview without a referral. Most of what can be called as my professional network (ex colleagues mostly) are in BPOs and some are still working as customer service agents in the project I started out with.
 
I've tried to reach out and request for any possible help from friends as well and now I'm here to request any advice you can share for me on how to proceed with job hunt or let me know if your organization is hiring in Gurgaon/DelhI/Noida. 
I have a total experience of about 7 years and have the general skills you can expect from a team leader in BPO (MS Office, Team management, etc). I have interest in Digital Marketing and I have expertise in Facebook Ads. I'm doing courses on Project Management and Business Analytics and planning to learn SQL and Python.
