Shopkeepers, friends, people are generally  kind until they see you speaking to other Indians. Then they become inquisitive, nosey and jealous - asking questions about your personal life and your relationships, demanding “why didn’t you buy from me!? Where have you been? ” It’s extremely uncomfortable. \n\nI have lived in many other countries before but India is the only place where this type of attitude/ jealousy is across the majority. \n\nAnother thing is I find their questions so degrading. “Where are you from? What is your job?” Then I see them calculating how to judge you (maybe this is a result of the caste system and them trying to figure us out). There is no “how are you? What’s up for you?” Not even a “what’s your name?” Nope. Just “what’s your job?” And often them asking you a question relating to how much money you have, and then “what’s your dad’s job?” After that, there is no deeper conversation, it seems they have all the information they need regarding how to interact with you.\n\nRecently I moved into a house. The landlord keeps showing up randomly, asking where I’ve been, what I’m doing. I had to get my laptop fixed and they demanded to see my laptop actually opening up my bag. They saw my iPhone “oh is that Apple? Must be expensive? How much you pay?” Constantly trying to work out how much I have?? \n\nPerhaps it’s because I’m a single woman too that they feel they can invade my boundaries this way? \n\nI’m sorry, but I’m just so fed up on this mannerless objectifying culture. Anyone shed any light?   ', 'upvotes': 1263}
